    shortDescription:
      "Amplify is a gamified guitar learning application I built to solve a problem I constantly faced: staying consistent with practice. The app features three main sections—Dashboard for tracking progress and XP, Jam Room to view chords/scales and interactive lessons, and The Shed for timed practice sessions. Built with React and deployed on Netlify, Amplify brings structure, clarity, and motivation back into learning guitar.",
